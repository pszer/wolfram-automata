Simulates elementary cellular automata with Wolfram codes 0-255

Run as
```
./rule [rule] {seed} {w} {h} {single}
```
[rule] argument is mandatory.
{seed} sets the random seed used for random starting state.
{w} is the width of the grid.
{h} is how many iterations of the automata to do (grid height).
argument 'single' sets the start state to be a single 1 in the center.

# Controls
Press up/down to switch.

Press space to switch between random/single start state.

Press 'r' to create new random seed.
